# Multi-Architecture Server Images

The collaboration server image supports Linux AMD64 and ARM64 hosts. The same
`Dockerfile.server` is used for both architectures; its Rust, Node.js, and
PostgreSQL base images provide architecture-matched layers.

## Local Build

Build both architectures into one OCI archive:

```bash
pnpm server:image:build
```

The default output is `dist-builds/collab-server-multiarch.tar`. An OCI archive
contains a multi-platform image index and is intended for inspection, transfer,
or later registry publication. Docker cannot load a multi-platform archive into
its classic local image store as one runnable image.

Override the image name, platforms, or output location when needed:

```bash
COLLAB_IMAGE_NAME=example/collab-server:test \
COLLAB_IMAGE_PLATFORMS=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
COLLAB_IMAGE_OUTPUT=/tmp/collab-server.tar \
pnpm server:image:build
```

For a quick image that runs on the current machine, continue using Compose:

```bash
docker compose build collab-server
```

Buildx requires QEMU/binfmt support when the host is not native to every target
architecture. Docker Desktop normally configures this automatically. On Linux,
install the Buildx plugin and register the required binfmt handlers before a
cross-architecture build.

## CI Artifacts

Manual runs of `.github/workflows/server-container-build.yml` build
`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` independently. Each matrix job uploads a
short-lived OCI archive:

- `collab-server-amd64`
- `collab-server-arm64`

Keeping architecture builds separate gives each architecture an independent
BuildKit cache and makes failures easy to identify. Manual builds do not log in
to a registry or publish an image. Automatic runs occur only for version tags
and publish the release image described below.

AMD64 runs on `ubuntu-latest`; ARM64 runs on GitHub's native
`ubuntu-24.04-arm` runner. Both jobs use plain BuildKit progress and run in
parallel, avoiding the much slower and occasionally quiet QEMU compilation path.

## Published Releases

Pushing a server version tag such as `server-v0.4.8` publishes a multi-platform image
to GitHub Container Registry:

```text
ghcr.io/azazel55605/collab-server:0.4.8
ghcr.io/azazel55605/collab-server:0.4
ghcr.io/azazel55605/collab-server:latest
```

The exact version tag identifies one release. The minor and `latest` tags are
operator conveniences and can move to a newer compatible release. Production
deployments should pin the exact version, or an image digest when immutable
identity is required.

Before publishing, the workflow verifies that the Git tag matches the server
version in `versions.json` and the Cargo workspace version synced from it.
Native AMD64 and ARM64 jobs each build once and push an untagged image by digest,
then scan that digest for high/critical known vulnerabilities. Only after both
jobs pass does a small final job assign the release tags to a combined manifest.
Failed scans therefore leave no deployable release tag. Each platform image
includes OCI source/version metadata, a BuildKit provenance attestation, and an
SBOM.

Run the version gate locally before creating a release tag:

```bash
pnpm server:release:check server-v0.4.8
```

Deploy a published image with the normal Compose stack:

```bash
COLLAB_SERVER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/azazel55605/collab-server:0.4.8 \
docker compose up -d --no-build
```

The GHCR package may need to be made public once in the repository/package
settings. Private installations can instead authenticate Docker to `ghcr.io`.
