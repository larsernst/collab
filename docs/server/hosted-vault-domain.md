# Hosted Vault Domain Model

## Identity and Ownership

All IDs are server-generated UUIDv7 values unless explicitly described otherwise.

| Entity | Important fields |
| --- | --- |
| User | `id`, `username`, `displayName`, `status`, timestamps |
| Session | `id`, `userId`, refresh-token family, expiry, revoked timestamp |
| Vault | `id`, `name`, `ownerUserId`, `status`, `manifestSequence`, timestamps |
| Membership | `vaultId`, `userId`, `role`, timestamps |
| FileEntry | `id`, `vaultId`, `parentId`, `name`, `kind`, `documentType`, `state`, current revision, timestamps |
| FileRevision | `id`, `fileId`, `sequence`, content/blob hash, size, creator, timestamp |
| Snapshot | `id`, `fileId`, revision/materialized CRDT reference, label, creator, timestamp |
| StructuralOperation | `id`, `clientOperationId`, `vaultId`, actor, base/result manifest sequence, type, payload, timestamp |
| ActivityEvent | `id`, `vaultId`, actor, type, target IDs, sanitized metadata, timestamp |
| CRDTDocument | `fileId`, protocol version, snapshot, update-tail position, materialized revision |
| Blob | SHA-256 digest, size, media type, storage key, reference state |

Folders are explicit `FileEntry` records. Relative paths are derived by walking `parentId` relationships and applying the hosted path rules.

The Phase 3 online API persists stable folder/document/asset IDs and derives
relative paths from their parent relationships. Text-backed note, Kanban, and
canvas documents commit immutable content-addressed revisions using optimistic
revision sequences. Bounded binary uploads verify caller-provided SHA-256
digests and deduplicate blobs. Rename, move, trash, restore, and purge are
idempotent structural operations ordered by the vault manifest sequence.
Snapshots label immutable revisions without changing current content. Restoring
a snapshot creates a new revision that references the preserved snapshot blob,
so no history is overwritten.

Active note revisions are represented in a derived PostgreSQL full-text index.
Index rows reference the exact current revision, contain searchable title,
content, and frontmatter tags, and are repaired or removed when search detects
that the current hosted revision or file state has changed.

## File Kinds and Document Types

`FileEntry.kind` is one of:

- `folder`
- `document`
- `asset`

`documentType` is required for documents and is one of:

- `note`
- `kanban`
- `canvas`

PDFs and images are assets. Hidden application metadata is represented by server tables or typed sidecar records rather than user-visible `.collab` file entries. Export materializes compatible `.collab` files where appropriate.

## File and Vault State

Vault state:

- `active`
- `archived`
- `pending_delete`

File state:

- `active`
- `trashed`
- `tombstoned`

Trash preserves the file ID, revisions, original parent/name, actor, and deletion timestamp. Purge creates a tombstone and releases blob references only after retention rules allow it.

## Revisions and Ordering

- Each file has a monotonic revision sequence.
- Each vault has a monotonic manifest sequence covering structural and committed content changes.
- REST mutations use `clientOperationId` for idempotency.
- Optimistic online writes before CRDT migration include the expected file revision.
- Snapshot restore includes the expected current revision and creates a new
  revision rather than moving the current pointer backward.
- CRDT materialization creates normal file revisions and increments the manifest sequence.

## Roles and Permissions

The owner is a distinguished user and always has administrative permissions. Ownership can only be transferred explicitly to an existing administrator.

| Action | Viewer | Editor | Admin | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Read vault, files, history, and members | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Join presence and receive awareness | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Send chat messages | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Edit documents and sidecars | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Create, rename, move, trash, and restore | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Purge trash or clear history | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| Import and export vaults | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| Invite/remove viewers and editors | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| Grant or remove admin role | No | No | No | Yes |
| Archive/delete vault or transfer ownership | No | No | No | Yes |

The server checks permissions for every REST mutation and every WebSocket subscription or update. UI checks are advisory only.

Server administrators sit above the vault role hierarchy. An active server
administrator can discover, read, download, import/export, and perform
admin-level content operations in every hosted vault without receiving a vault
membership. This implicit operator access does not make the server
administrator the vault owner and does not bypass the protected owner
membership; server-operator lifecycle and membership actions remain auditable
through `/api/v1/admin/vaults`, while content mutations record normal vault
activity with the acting server administrator.

Phase 3 REST role enforcement is covered as a server-side endpoint matrix:
viewers may use read, search, history, reference, and storage endpoints but are
rejected by every mutation family; editors may perform content and structural
mutations except purge; admins may purge, import/export, rename vaults, and
manage viewer/editor memberships; owner checks protect archive/delete and
admin-role membership changes.

## Storage Accounting

`GET /api/v1/vaults/{vaultId}/storage` exposes logical per-vault accounting:

- `activeBytes` and `trashBytes` count current revisions by file state.
- `retainedRevisionBytes` counts all retained revision payloads.
- `uniqueBlobBytes` deduplicates identical retained payloads within the vault.
- File, revision, and snapshot counts expose the retained object footprint.

Global physical blob usage may be lower because the blob store deduplicates
content across vaults. Vault summaries keep using retained revision bytes.

## Import and Export

Import:

- Accept ZIP archives and later native folder-upload streams.
- Reject symlinks, hard links, absolute paths, path traversal, duplicate normalized paths, unsupported path names, decompression bombs, and configured size-limit violations.
- Ignore runtime presence data.
- Preserve supported vault files and compatible `.collab` metadata.
- Generate stable hosted IDs and hosted revisions during import.
- Report rejected or repaired entries before committing the import.

The initial API accepts bounded ZIP imports only into empty active hosted
vaults. It rejects unsafe or duplicate normalized paths, symlinks, excessive
entry counts, oversized files/expanded archives, and invalid UTF-8 text
documents before database commit. Runtime `.collab/` content is ignored.

Export:

- Produce a ZIP that opens as a normal local vault.
- Materialize current notes, Kanban boards, canvases, assets, and compatible sidecars.
- Include a compatible `.collab/vault.json`, snapshots/history, templates, and trash according to export options.
- Exclude sessions, credentials, server audit records, ephemeral awareness, internal CRDT logs, and runtime presence.

The initial export materializes active folders and each active file's current
revision. Snapshot/history and trash export options remain follow-up work.

## Compatibility Rules

- Hosted storage does not change existing local-vault formats.
- Local-vault encryption is not carried into hosted storage. An encrypted local vault must be unlocked client-side before import.
- Hosted content is server-readable and protected through authentication, authorization, TLS, filesystem/database permissions, and encrypted infrastructure backups.
