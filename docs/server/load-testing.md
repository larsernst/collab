# Load Testing

The load test exists to size a deployment and to confirm that the gateway,
health checks, rate limiting, and authenticated hosted-vault reads behave under
concurrency. It is a coarse capacity check, not a synthetic full-collaboration
benchmark (live WebSocket co-editing convergence is covered by the server's
two-client `ws::` integration tests).

## Running It

Start the server first, then drive load against the gateway:

```bash
docker compose up --wait            # or: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
pnpm server:load-test
```

Equivalent script:

```bash
./scripts/server-load-test.sh
```

The script preflights `/health/ready`, then runs read load against the
liveness, readiness, bootstrap-status, and admin-SPA endpoints. It uses the
first available load generator (`oha`, then `hey`, then `wrk`) and falls back to
a portable concurrent `curl` loop with coarse timing when none is installed.

### Include authenticated traffic

Provide credentials to also load the authenticated hosted-vault list
(`GET /api/v1/vaults`):

```bash
COLLAB_LOAD_USERNAME=admin \
COLLAB_LOAD_PASSWORD='…' \
  pnpm server:load-test
```

### Tuning

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `COLLAB_LOAD_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8788` | Target gateway URL. |
| `COLLAB_LOAD_DURATION` | `30s` | Duration per endpoint (`oha`/`hey`/`wrk`). |
| `COLLAB_LOAD_CONCURRENCY` | `50` | Concurrent connections/workers. |
| `COLLAB_LOAD_REQUESTS` | `1000` | Total requests for the `curl` fallback only. |
| `COLLAB_LOAD_USERNAME` / `COLLAB_LOAD_PASSWORD` | unset | Enables the authenticated phase. |

## Interpreting Results

- **Health and admin endpoints are never rate limited.** Sustained throughput
  here reflects raw proxy + process capacity.
- **`/api/v1/*` traffic is rate limited** by `COLLAB_REST_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`
  (default 1200/min per client IP). A capacity run that exceeds it will show
  `429 RATE_LIMITED` responses — that is the limiter working, not a failure. To
  measure raw capacity instead, raise or disable (`0`) the limit in a
  disposable environment; to verify the limiter, keep the default and confirm
  `429`s with a `Retry-After` header appear.
- **Because the gateway sets `X-Forwarded-For`, all load from one host shares a
  single rate-limit bucket.** Distributed clients each get their own bucket.
- Watch the admin dashboard during the run: storage pressure, live-room counts,
  and CRDT compaction backlog are the operational signals that matter under
  load.

## Results Template

Record a dated run when validating a release or sizing a host:

## Relationship to Other Checks

- Functional/regression load on live collaboration is exercised by
  `cargo test -p collab-server ws::` (two-client convergence, viewer denial,
  permission rechecks).
- Backup/restore under a realistic dataset is covered by
  `./scripts/server-backup-restore-smoke.sh`.
- This load test complements the [deployment topology](./deployment-topology.md)
  sizing table — use measured numbers to move between its tiers.
