Local-first vault-based knowledge work for Markdown notes, canvases, Kanban boards,
PDFs, images, and collaboration.

`collab` is a Tauri 2 desktop app built with React 19, TypeScript, Rust, and
CodeMirror 6. Local vaults remain first-class and stay on disk. Existing
shared-folder collaboration works through vault metadata, and a self-hosted
collaboration server provides authenticated users, hosted vaults, server-backed
permissions, live co-editing, and offline synchronization.

The server foundation, authentication, administration, hosted-vault content,
live co-editing, and offline-sync phases are implemented. They include
PostgreSQL-backed identities, Argon2id credentials, secure browser and native
sessions, expiring invitations, audit events, a Collab-style admin web
interface, a desktop server connection flow, server-backed CRDT live editing
over WebSocket, and a native offline replica with reconnect convergence.
Published multi-architecture (AMD64/ARM64) server images are released to GitHub
Container Registry and run with a single production Compose file.

  pending-operation queue, CRDT-state caching, integrity checks, reconnect
  convergence, and a status-bar sync/conflict recovery indicator
- Operational hardening: server-wide storage quota and warnings, per-client-IP
  REST/WebSocket rate limiting, and a retention/compaction maintenance worker
- Published multi-architecture (AMD64/ARM64) images on GitHub Container Registry,
  built and vulnerability-scanned per platform before release tags are assigned
- TLS certificates are verified by default. Private servers using self-signed
  certificates can explicitly enable **Allow untrusted TLS certificates** in
  Server Settings; installing the private CA on the device remains the safer
  production approach.

Remaining server work is tracked in
[COLLAB_SERVER_PLAN.md](./COLLAB_SERVER_PLAN.md).

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- `pnpm` 10+
- Rust stable toolchain
- Tauri 2 system dependencies for your platform
- Docker with Docker Compose for the collaboration server
- `curl` for server smoke tests

Linux packaging and install notes live in
[docs/linux-install.md](./docs/linux-install.md).

## Build Instructions

Install JavaScript dependencies once:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Desktop App

Run the complete desktop app in development:

```bash
pnpm tauri dev
```

Build a production desktop bundle:

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

Run only the browser frontend without the Tauri shell:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Admin Web Interface

Run the focused server administration interface locally:

```bash
pnpm admin:dev
```

Build and type-check its production bundle:

```bash
pnpm admin:build
```

The development server proxies API requests to a collaboration server listening
on `127.0.0.1:8787`.

### Collaboration Server With Docker Compose

The repository ships two Compose files:

| File | Use it for | Image |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docker-compose.yml` | **Production / releases (recommended for most users)** | Pulls the published GHCR image; never builds |
| `compose.yaml` | Self-building, local development, and testing | Builds the server from source |

Both bring up PostgreSQL, the collaboration server, and a Caddy gateway, share
the same `.env` configuration, and use the same persistent volumes.

#### Run a published release (recommended)

`docker-compose.yml` is self-contained: the only file you need beside it is a
`.env`. The Caddy gateway config is embedded inline, and the backup/restore
helpers are baked into the published image, so there are no host bind mounts to
provide. Download just `docker-compose.yml` (and `.env.example` for reference),
then:

```bash
# Create .env with at least a strong POSTGRES_PASSWORD, e.g.:
#   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-long-random-password
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

This pulls `ghcr.io/azazel55605/collab-server:latest`. For production, pin an
exact version in `.env` so upgrades are deliberate:

```bash
# .env
COLLAB_SERVER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/azazel55605/collab-server:0.4.8
```

Upgrade later by bumping that tag and re-pulling:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

#### Build from source (development / testing)

```bash
docker compose up --build --wait
```

The source image uses `cargo-chef` to cache Rust dependencies, and the admin-web
image stage caches JavaScript dependency installation separately from source
changes.

#### Access, networking, and lifecycle

The gateway listens on port `8788` on all host interfaces by default:

- Admin interface: `http://<server-address>:8788/` (redirects to `/admin/`)
- Liveness: `http://127.0.0.1:8788/health/live`
- Readiness: `http://127.0.0.1:8788/health/ready`

On first launch, open the admin interface to bootstrap the initial
administrator account.

Set `COLLAB_HTTP_BIND=127.0.0.1` to keep the gateway local-only. Public
deployments should place the gateway behind HTTPS and set
`COLLAB_BROWSER_SECURE_COOKIES=true`; see
[docs/server/tls-and-secrets.md](./docs/server/tls-and-secrets.md) and
`deploy/Caddyfile.tls.example`.

Automated backups are available through the optional `backup` profile (and
restore through the `restore` profile); see
[docs/server/backups.md](./docs/server/backups.md).

Stop the containers while preserving data (add `-f docker-compose.yml` for the
release stack):

```bash
docker compose down
```

Delete the containers and their persistent volumes:

```bash
docker compose down --volumes
```

### Flatpak

Build the local Flatpak package:

```bash
./flatpak/build-local.sh
```

### Verification

Run the full project verification set:

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm admin:test
pnpm admin:build
cargo test --workspace
cargo check --workspace
docker compose config
./scripts/server-smoke.sh
```

The live PostgreSQL server tests require a disposable database:

```bash
COLLAB_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://collab:password@127.0.0.1:5432/collab_test \
  cargo test -p collab-server
```

The authentication lifecycle test truncates the Phase 2 identity tables, so do
not point it at a database containing valuable data.

## Security Advisories

Dependencies are scanned in CI by the `Security Scan` workflow
(`cargo audit`, `pnpm audit`, and Trivy over the server image). Any advisory
that cannot yet be fixed by an upgrade is an explicit, documented risk
acceptance rather than a silent suppression: the machine-readable ignore list
lives in [`.cargo/audit.toml`](./.cargo/audit.toml), and every entry there has a
matching explanation — dependency path, why it is not reachable, why it is
unfixed, and the condition to drop it — in
[docs/security-advisories.md](./docs/security-advisories.md).

Currently accepted: `RUSTSEC-2023-0071` (`rsa`, reachable only through the
unused MySQL backend) and `RUSTSEC-2026-0194` (`quick-xml`, build-time macOS
bundling only, blocked on an upstream `plist` release). Keep the tracking doc in
sync whenever `.cargo/audit.toml` changes.

## Notes For Contributors

- Frontend code should go through typed wrappers in `src/lib/tauri.ts` instead of calling Tauri plugins directly from components
- Paths crossing the IPC boundary are relative to the vault root
- Normal file listing/indexing excludes `.collab/` and generated dependency/build directories
- `write_note` uses optimistic locking via `expected_hash`
- Shared document-style viewers should follow the `DocumentTopBar` pattern
